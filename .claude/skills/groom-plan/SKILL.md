description: Harden the todo tree for a weaker executor -- sequence check, drift sweep, gap scan, complete-feature pass, backlog triage (promote or leave; never drop) -- without moving rows between phases, ticking boxes, or starting a campaign. Use before a long run, or when the plan feels stale.

# Groom Plan

## Evidence before reordering

```bash
python scripts/todo-graph.py query sequence
```

It prints the longest dependency chain, which is where delay costs most, and every coupling the review findings recorded: a section that filed a finding to another section ran into work that section owns, which the dependency graph does not carry.

Read what it says about direction before acting on it. **A filing is not proof the order is wrong.** Most filings are work discovered early rather than work needed first, and nothing in the data separates those. Acting on the signal alone can invert a correct order, which is exactly what happened in the plan this system was ported from.

The command proposes and cannot act: it opens no file for writing. Reordering happens here, by hand, with the addresses and cross-references kept consistent as below.

Hardening the tree so a weaker executor can run it. Grooming adds prerequisites and fills gaps; it never moves a row out of its phase, never ticks a box, never deletes a backlog entry without a trace, never changes `todo/budget.json`, and never starts a campaign.

Record the groom's start commit (`git rev-parse HEAD`) and a run id first (`python scripts/campaign_guard.py mint-generation`, or the campaign's `run_id` when a campaign runs the groom): every section the groom files of its own finding carries `**Origin:** discovered run=<run id> <YYYY-MM-DD> -- groom-plan <step>` directly under its heading, so the groom record and `python scripts/todo-graph.py query growth --since <start>` can show what it added. Nothing caps how many (operator decision 2026-09-27: "the cap is worrying me, because I'm worried features will be left behind."). Sections the operator asks for during a groom are operator-directed: no Origin line.

## Workflow

### 1. Sequence check

For every dependency edge (section-level `Depends On` and file-level `depends_on`), confirm the prerequisite sits no later than its consumer in phase/row order. Where an edge points later:

- Prefer adding or splitting the prerequisite under the consumer's phase (a small new section with a dated note), so the consumer's row can run in order.
- Never move the consumer's row: phase membership is stable, and moving rows rewrites the plan's history.
- Record each fix with `**Corrected YYYY-MM-DD:**` or `**Groomed YYYY-MM-DD:**`.

Run `python scripts/todo-graph.py validate` after every structural edit. Cycles are FATAL: break them at authoring time.

### 2. Drift sweep

Walk every open section's concrete claims against today's repository: projects, classes, XAML files, paths, package versions, settings keys, counts. Correct drift in place with dated notes, exactly as `process-todo-section` steps 2-3 do, but tree-wide and without building anything.

```bash
python scripts/todo-claims.py              # re-measure what the TODOs claim
python scripts/todo-claims.py --coverage   # Current state blocks nothing re-measures
```

Pay special attention to:

- "Nothing exists yet" claims that are no longer true.
- Counts and versions quoted confidently (these age fastest): SDK, package, and target framework versions especially.
- Paths under `src/Stilus/` and `src/Gesso/` that the imports and renames moved.
- Deferrals whose descriptions drifted while their owners stayed open.
- XREFs whose targets moved or shipped (reciprocity still holds, or the line is corrected).
- **Design lines** (`standards/design-contract.md`): every open section whose Fidelity line names a surface carries a live `**Design:**` line (`python scripts/todo-graph.py query design` counts them; `validate` fails a dead ref). For each section still listed in `todo/.design-baseline`, write its Design line from the specs its surface needs (component READMEs under `docs/design/components/`, `docs/design/shell-layout.md` region anchors, `standards/ui.md` anchors), rewrite any Fidelity line that still names an old-app capture under `docs/captures/<app>/` as its source so it names the design and its golden folder, and shrink the baseline in the same commit with `python scripts/todo-graph.py design-baseline`; the baseline never grows. A surface no spec covers gets `new surface: docs/design/<path>.md` plus the item that writes that spec first. Record each with `**Groomed YYYY-MM-DD:**`.
- **Design deviations**: `python scripts/todo-graph.py query design` lists them; an open one whose follow-up drifted or whose reason is gone is corrected, and one sitting in front of an app release is sequenced so its follow-up ships first.

### 3. Gap scan

Read the plan as the user will use each finished app, domain by domain, and ask what has no owner: surfaces, commands, handoffs between apps (Albumen to Gesso, Gesso to Stilus), error paths, settings without consumers, writes without readback. File each gap with `add-todo` (evidence, owner, dependency), which applies the admission test and stamps the Origin line: a gap becomes a section (or an item on an open section that can hold it) when it is a defect in shipped or in-flight work, something an acceptance-bar aim requires, or a prerequisite of a planned row. Nice-to-haves go to the backlog, where they are kept. Place any new rows in their phases and sync the plan.

Check the Adjacency declarations while here: `python scripts/todo-graph.py query adjacency` advisories that name real gaps become sections; ones that are already covered get their anchors sharpened.

### 4. Complete-feature pass

For every UI surface in the plan, confirm the feature is whole: list, find, create, edit, delete (or the honest not-applicable), settings with consumers, refusal paths exercised (read-only file, locked file, unsupported format), undo for every edit, and the reverse of every create. For every write to a user's document or library, confirm the atomic save, the readback, the recovery path, and the log line. For every type in `Isotone.Core`, confirm at least two apps consume it, and for every pattern duplicated across two apps, confirm a section moves it into `Isotone.Core`. File what is missing through `add-todo` (these usually pass the admission test, because the acceptance bar names undo, atomic saves, and shared code), preferring an item on the owning section to a new section; do not redesign what exists.

### 5. Backlog triage

```bash
python scripts/todo-graph.py query backlog
python scripts/todo-graph.py query budget
```

The backlog has no cap, so triage is never about room. On every groom, walk it: each entry is either promoted or left, and nothing is dropped on the groom's own judgement (operator decision 2026-09-27, "No drop without operator approval"; `validate` fails an entry that leaves without a trace as `backlog-dropped`):

- **Promote what has come due**: an entry whose `promote when` has come true and that passes the admission test is promoted through `add-todo` (the promoting commit writes the section, with its Origin line and the entry's `source` as its `-> SOURCE:` line, and deletes the entry).
- **Leave the rest**: an entry not yet due stays as it is. Correct a drifted `needs:` ref or summary in place.
- **Merge duplicates**: two entries for one real-world thing become one. Keep the lower id, fold the other's text into the survivor's summary, and keep the absorbed entry's key as a merge marker, ``merged: `<source-key>` (B-NNN, YYYY-MM-DD)``, in the survivor's summary or as its own `merged:` field. The marker stays for as long as the survivor lives; removing it later is `backlog-dropped` unless its key has since been promoted.
- **Stale entries are the operator's call**: an idea that looks overtaken by shipped work, a decision, or a removed feature is listed in the groom record with the reason and put to the operator. Only when the operator approves in words does the entry leave: delete it and append `- B-NNN <source> -- removed YYYY-MM-DD -- operator: "<their words, verbatim>"` under `## Removed with operator approval` at the end of `todo/backlog.md`. Never paraphrase the words, and never delete a removal record.

### 6. Report and commit

Write the groom record: what was sequenced, what drifted and was corrected, what gaps were filed and where they landed (sections versus backlog), what the backlog triage promoted and merged (with each merge marker), which stale entries were put to the operator and what the operator said, the run id and the discovered sections it filed, and the size line the Progress block now shows. Commit as `todo: groom <scope> (<date>)` after a final `validate` plus `plan --sync` plus `plan --check`.

## Guardrails

- Do not move a row out of its phase. Add or split prerequisites instead.
- Do not tick a box. Grooming never ships.
- Do not start a campaign. Grooming prepares one.
- Do not redesign sections. Harden them.
- Do not file a discovered section without its Origin line, and do not change `todo/budget.json`.
- Do not delete a backlog entry, a merge marker, or a removal record except by promotion, by a merge that keeps the key, or with the operator's recorded words.
- Do not leave the tree unvalidated. `validate` plus `plan --check` pass before the commit.
- Do not add a ref to `todo/.design-baseline` or an entry to `docs/design/.lint-baseline.json`. Both only shrink.
