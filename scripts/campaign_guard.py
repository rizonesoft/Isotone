A campaign run has three parts. The guard file (`build/claude-campaign-guard.json`) names the session that owns the
run, its phase, scope, run file, heartbeat job and run id; it is written and deleted only through this module, under
an interprocess lock. The Stop hook (`stop-hook`, wired in `.claude/settings.json`) blocks that session's end of turn
while the run is open and lets go when the run file carries this run's `## Closeout run=<id>` heading or column-0
`PARKED <UTC> run=<id>` line, when `query ready` reads `0 runnable now` (a plan-scoped run only), or when the stall
breaker trips after 3 blocks with no change to the tree. The heartbeat is a `CronCreate` job inside the session
(process-plan holds its prompt) that resumes an idle run, the plan or only its phase as the guard's scope says. There
is no keep-alive outside the session: a session that died is resumed by the operator, and the new session takes the
guard with `acquire --handover`.

The hook fails open on a bad payload, a missing guard or any error, and records the error for the heartbeat to report
(`hook-error`). `repair` persists the CI repair episode the review skill's push block bounds at 3 attempts. Every
command takes `--root` to act on a fixture workspace instead of this repository. The hook and the scope replaced
the former `.claude/hooks/campaign-stop.ps1` (2026-10-21).

The self-test drives the configured hook command with Stop payloads against a throwaway workspace (a git repository,
a guard file, a run file, and a fake `scripts/todo-graph.py` whose runnable count the test controls) and asserts every
allow and block case, the stall breaker, the lifecycle commands, and the repair ledger.
